# 🌍 COVID-19 Dashboard - India 🇮🇳

## 📊 Overview

This project focuses on building an interactive **COVID-19 Dashboard** using **Power BI** for visualization and **Jupyter Notebook** for data cleaning and analysis. The dashboard provides an in-depth view of COVID-19 trends and forecasts in India, based on the available data. 

## 🛠️ Key Features:
- **Active Cases, Confirmed Cases, and Death Cases** visualized over time 📅
- A **State-wise Analysis** showing detailed trends in each region of India 🗺️
- Insights into **Male vs Female Vaccination** distribution across India 💉
- **Trend Forecasting**: Projections of cases and deaths until 2030 🔮

## 🔧 Tools and Libraries Used:
- **Power BI**: Used for building the interactive dashboard 📊
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for data preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization 📝
- **Python Libraries**:
  - **Pandas**: Data wrangling and manipulation 🐼
  - **Seaborn**: Advanced statistical visualizations 📈
  - **NumPy**: Efficient data processing 🔢
  - **Matplotlib**: Basic visualization of trends and graphs 📉

## 🔄 Steps Involved:
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Cleaned and preprocessed COVID-19 data from various sources using **Pandas** 📂
2. **Visualization**: Created visual representations of COVID-19 trends using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** 📊
3. **Dashboard Creation**: Imported the processed data into **Power BI** for building the final interactive dashboard 🔄
4. **Forecasting**: Implemented basic trend forecasting of COVID-19 cases and death numbers until 2030 ⏳
