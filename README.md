# COVID-19 Dashboard - India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³

## Overview

This project focuses on building an interactive **COVID-19 Dashboard** using **Power BI** for visualization and **Jupyter Notebook** for data cleaning and analysis. The dashboard provides an in-depth view of COVID-19 trends and forecasts in India, based on the available data.

## Key Features:
- **Active Cases, Confirmed Cases, and Death Cases** visualized over time.
- A **State-wise Analysis** showing detailed trends in each region of India.
- Insights into **Male vs Female Vaccination** distribution across India.
- **Trend Forecasting**: Projections of cases and deaths until 2030.

## Tools and Libraries Used:
- **Power BI**: Used for building the interactive dashboard.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for data preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization.
- **Python Libraries**:
  - **Pandas**: Data wrangling and manipulation.
  - **Seaborn**: Advanced statistical visualizations.
  - **NumPy**: Efficient data processing.
  - **Matplotlib**: Basic visualization of trends and graphs.

## Steps Involved:
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Cleaned and preprocessed COVID-19 data from various sources using **Pandas**.
2. **Visualization**: Created visual representations of COVID-19 trends using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.
3. **Dashboard Creation**: Imported the processed data into **Power BI** for building the final interactive dashboard with filters and trends.
4. **Forecasting**: Implemented basic trend forecasting of COVID-19 cases and death numbers until 2030.
